# llm_web
Plugin for [llm](https://llm.datasette.io/) by the great [simonw](https://simonwillison.net/) to add a simple langchain agent that searches the web.

## Note
* to install: `llm install llm-web`
* to run: `llm chat -m web`
* Very early stage, done mostly while procrastinating work. Will improve a lot.

## TODO
* tell simonw
* make autonomous agent more stable
* find a way to implement streaming
* *later* use griptape instead of langchain when they implement their search?
